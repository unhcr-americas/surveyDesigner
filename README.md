`{surveyDesigner}` is a shinyApp to parse a master referential of questions and indicators to generate a contextualized series of [xlsform](http://xlsform.org) questionnaires.


For the end-user, aka the Survey Coordinator at Operation level, the application is expected to: 

  1. Enforce a questionnaire design process that __starts from a selection of indicators__ that needs to be measured and pre-select automatically all the required standardized survey modules and questions in order to measure them. Not only this ensure that standards are actually used, but it will also minimize the risk of questionnaire design mistakes: "_collect what you need, use what you collect_"  
  
  2. Ease the __contextualization process__ from the global referential to the actual implementation in each country (i.e translating and adjusting the labels as per the specific context) and facilitate the feedback loop so that if the same ad-hoc questions are used in multiple context, they can be considered for inclusion in the global referential 
  
  3. Support the usage of [mixed-mode (CAPI/CATI?CAWI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRmy2OAnyWc) and multiple data collection waves to collect the final dataset within an __annual survey data collection cycle__, all of this allowing both to promote survey integration and to maximize the financial resources invested in those activities  

Overall, this will contribute over time to the creation of [standardized survey-based indicators](https://egrisstats.org/resource/data-disaggregation-of-sdg-indicators-by-forced-displacement/) for comparative data analysis across countries and contexts.

## Run the app  

The app is still under development - the prototype is accessible here: https://rstudio.unhcr.org/Survey_Designer/ 

To run it locally, use

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("unhcr-americas/surveyDesigner")
# Run the application
surveyDesigner::run_app()
```

## For developpers

The app is build using [`{golem}` framework](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem) and following the tutorial: [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org//).
